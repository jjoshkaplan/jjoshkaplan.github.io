To explore the relationship between financial investment and playoff performance, the plot below clusters postseason teams into spending tiers. These tiers are defined relative to each sport-season’s interquartile range (IQR):  
- **Low**: Below the IQR  
- **Medium**: Within the IQR  
- **High**: Above the IQR  

Using a consistent color scheme as previous graphics (MLB:Blue, NFL:Green, NBA:Orange): the visualization reveals how different levels of spending correspond to playoff success across leagues.

This chart also highlights championship teams.
In **MLB** and the **NBA**, champions typically log higher playoff win totals due to the extended best-of-five and best-of-seven series formats. By contrast, the **NFL’s** single-elimination format results in fewer total wins, even for champions.

Several key takeaways emerge:
- In **MLB** and **NBA**, low-spending teams rarely advance far, while medium and high spenders perform similarly in terms of wins and titles.
- Medium-tier teams have proven capable of winning championships, countering the notion that only the top spenders succeed.
- In the **NFL**, there is greater parity—each spending tier has produced at least three champions in the past decade.

These trends emphasize how postseason structure and league-specific dynamics shape the impact of financial strategy on ultimate success.

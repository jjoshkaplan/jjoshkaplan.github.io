To begin our exploration into the relationship between financial investment and team performance, the below visualization compares each team’s **win percentage** to whether their **payroll was above or below the league median** for that sport and season.

By normalizing payroll relative to the **median salary per league and year**, we control for inflation, economic growth, and structural differences across sports allowing for more meaningful comparisons across teams, leagues, and seasons.

This visualization helps assess whether higher spending consistently correlates with better on-field results—and to what extent lower-spending teams can still compete.

While higher-spending teams **generally perform better**, the plot also reveals **many teams that outperform expectations**:
- Specifically, the **top-left quadrant** highlights teams with **above-average win percentages despite operating on below-median payrolls**—true overachievers

To quantify this, we calculated the **correlation coefficient** between salary (relative to the median) and win percentage across all leagues and seasons. Although there is a **positive trend**, the overall **correlation is weak to moderate and not statistically significant** (_p > 0.05_). This suggests that **payroll alone is not a reliable predictor** of team success.

Before analyzing the relationship between financial investment and on-field success, it’s crucial to first examine annual spending patterns across the major sports leagues.

## Cash Rules Everything Around the Leagues

The box-and-whisker plot above uses color to distinguish MLB, NFL, and NBA teams, revealing how team payrolls have evolved over time:

- The **box** shows the interquartile range (middle 50%)
- The **line** within the box marks the median
- The **whiskers** extend to capture the outer 50% of values, identifying variability and outliers

Key Observations:

- **MLB** exhibits the widest payroll disparity, with a significant gap between top and bottom spenders.
- **NFL** teams cluster tightly due to the league's strict salary cap and floor. Though spending started near MLB's median, it has since surpassed it.
- **NBA** payrolls began below both MLB and NFL levels but have grown rapidly, now rivaling or exceeding MLB median values. 
- Top end **MLB** teams show significant year-to-year variability because of harsh penalties, while  **NFL** and **NBA** payrolls rise more steadily, aside from a dip during COVID.

COVID-19 pandemic disruptions varied by league:

- **MLB** had the most dramatic financial impact, as its season coincided with the start of lockdowns reducing the length of the season by 100 games
- **NFL** escaped major disruption with its Super Bowl wrapping up just before COVID took hold.
- **NBA** paused mid-season and resumed later in a “bubble,” delaying the following season’s start

These unique timelines help explain some fluctuations in league-wide financial trends during 2020–2021.

## Does More Money Mean More Wins?

To evaluate the relationship between payroll and team performance, the visualization below compares **win percentage** to whether each team spent **above or below the league median** for that season.

By normalizing payroll against the **league-season median**, we account for inflation and structural differences allowing fair comparisons across time and sport.

What We Found:

- **Higher spending generally correlates with better win percentages**
- However, the **correlation is weak to moderate and not statistically significant** (_p > 0.05_)
- Many teams in the **top-left quadrant** outperformed expectations, winning >50% of their games while spending less than their league’s median payroll

These overachievers demonstrate that **money helps but isn’t everything**.

## Playoff Performance by Spending Tier

The next plot segments playoff teams into spending tiers, **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**, based on their position relative to their sport-season's interquartile range (IQR).

  title="Playoff Wins by Spending Tier"
  height="750"
%}

Insights by League:

- Low-spending **MLB & NBA** can make the playoffs but rarely make deep runs while Medium and High spenders show similar postseason success.
- Every spending tier in the **NFL** has produced at least **three champions**, showcasing greater competitive balance.
- Medium-spending teams across leagues have proven capable of **winning it all**, breaking the myth that only top dollar buys titles.

Differences in playoff structure:  
MLB and NBA champs often have **more playoff wins** due to longer series formats, while NFL champs max out at fewer wins due to its single-elimination format.

## When Payroll Meets Performance: Who Really Wins?

Finally, we visualize each team’s **regular season win percentage** against their **payroll status** relative to the league median and highlight champions.

Championship Takeaways:

- **4 NFL teams** have won championships spending **below the league median**, thanks to league parity, salary floor, and the hard cap.
- **2 MLB teams** have won championships spending **below the league median** thanks to key strategic team building decisions, but not without an asterisk:
  -  The **2017 Houston Astros** implemented a complex cheating scheme to overachieve and win the World Series.
- **High Winning Percentage** in the regular season is often necessary for title contention especially for teams near the median salary across all sports.
- But even **high spending + elite records** don’t ensure titles.
  - The top-right quadrant features teams that dominated the regular season **yet fell short in the playoffs**.

## Using Salary Spending for Predictive Modeling

To further investigate the impact of payrolls on team performance, we designed a predictive model. We trained the model using linear regression on various features from each sport in order to predict the percentage of games a team would win in a given season. If team spending on player salary had a significant impact on whether teams could win games, we would expect our model to perform better when it trains with salary information than without.

Since our data spanned ten seasons, we used multiple sets of seasons for training in order to cross validate our model. Starting with the first season, we would train our model on N seasons, and test against the N+1 season. We would then increase the number of training seasons until the model trained on all but the last season. This provided us with nine batches of training and testing data. This process of training and testing against consecutive seasons was designed to avoid data leakage. For example, with N=3 training years, we would train the regression model on the 2015 to 2017 seasons for a sport and test against the 2018 season.

Across all sports, we used standardized score differential alongside several sport-specific performance statistics as features in order to predict game win percentage. We trained and tested the model twice for each batch of data - once with salary information as an additional training feature and once without. The models were scored using the R² regression score function. This coefficient of determination shows how well our chosen features explain the variation in win percentage. Thus, if salary played an important role in how well a team played in a season, we would expect a higher R² score when we provide salary information in our model.

![NBA model performance plot](/assets/plots/nba_model_performance.svg "NBA model performance when predicting win percentage")

![NFL model performance plot](/assets/plots/nfl_model_performance.svg "NFL model performance when predicting win percentage")

When we plot our model performance for each of the sports, it becomes clear that this is not the case. Broadly speaking, the model performs roughly the same whether player salary is included or not. One trend to observe is that our model performs notably better for the MLB and the NBA than it does for the NFL. This is likely due to how there are far fewer games played in a football season than the other two sports, so there is inherent variability in the win percentage our model is trying to predict. By tweaking our chosen features and model parameters, we could likely improve the model performance across all three sports. But the result would be the same; salary has little to no impact on predicting how many games a team will win in a season.

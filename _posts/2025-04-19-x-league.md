Before analyzing the relationship between financial investment and on-field success, it’s crucial to first examine annual spending patterns across the major sports leagues.

The box-and-whisker plot above uses color to distinguish MLB, NFL, and NBA teams, revealing how team payrolls have evolved over time:
- The **box** shows the interquartile range (middle 50%)
- The **line** within the box marks the median
- The **whiskers** extend to capture the outer 50% of values, identifying variability and outliers

**Key Observations**:
- **MLB** exhibits the widest payroll disparity, with a significant gap between top and bottom spenders.
- **NFL** teams cluster tightly due to the league's strict salary cap and floor. Though spending started near MLB's median, it has since surpassed it.
- **NBA** payrolls began below both MLB and NFL levels but have grown rapidly, now rivaling or exceeding MLB median values.

### COVID-Era Impact

Pandemic disruptions varied by league:
- **MLB** had the most dramatic financial impact, as its season coincided with the start of lockdowns.
- **NFL** escaped major disruption with its Super Bowl wrapping up just before COVID took hold.
- **NBA** paused mid-season and resumed later in a “bubble,” delaying the following season’s start.

These unique timelines help explain some fluctuations in league-wide financial trends during 2020–2021.

## Does More Money Mean More Wins?

To evaluate the relationship between payroll and team performance, the visualization below compares **win percentage** to whether each team spent **above or below the league median** for that season.

By normalizing payroll against the **league-season median**, we account for inflation and structural differences allowing fair comparisons across time and sport.

**What We Found**:
- **Higher spending generally correlates with better win percentages**
- However, the **correlation is weak to moderate and not statistically significant** (_p > 0.05_)
- Many teams in the **top-left quadrant** outperformed expectations, winning >50% of their games while spending less than their league’s median payroll

These overachievers demonstrate that **money helps but isn’t everything**.

## Playoff Performance by Spending Tier

The next plot segments playoff teams into spending tiers, **Low**, **Medium**, and **High**, based on their position relative to their sport-season's interquartile range (IQR).

 **Insights by League**:
- **MLB & NBA**: Low-spending teams rarely make deep runs. Medium and high spenders show similar postseason success.
- **NFL**: Every spending tier has produced at least **three champions**, showcasing greater competitive balance.
- Medium-spending teams across leagues have proven capable of **winning it all**, breaking the myth that only top dollar buys titles.

Differences in playoff structure also matter:  
MLB and NBA champs often have **more playoff wins** due to longer series formats, while NFL champs max out at fewer wins due to its single-elimination format.

## When Payroll Meets Performance: Who Really Wins?

Finally, we visualize each team’s **regular season win percentage** against their **payroll status** relative to the league median and highlight champions.

**Final Takeaways**:
- **Only NFL teams** have won championships **while spending below the league median**, thanks to league parity, salary floor, and the hard cap.
- **Overachieving regular seasons** are often necessary for title contention especially for teams near the median.
- But even **high spending + elite records** don’t ensure titles. 
  - The top-right quadrant features teams that dominated the regular season **yet fell short in the playoffs**.

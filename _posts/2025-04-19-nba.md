The NBA has implemented several financial rules to maintain competitive balance and prevent wealthier teams from dominating the league.

In the last 10 years, the league has introduced stricter spending rules, including a **hard cap** that severely restricts teams exceeding it. These teams lose key roster-building tools, like trading future draft picks, signing mid-level free agents, or using buyout players. The **luxury tax** also penalizes overspending, with repeat offenders facing steeper fines, and the money collected is redistributed to smaller-market teams. Further, **Revenue sharing** helps smaller-market teams compete financially, while rookie contracts and minimum-salary rules keep costs predictable. Player salaries are structured around the salary cap ($136 million in 2023â€“24), with max contracts varying by experience (25â€“35% of the cap). The **Supermax**, introduced in 2017, lets teams pay franchise players even more to encourage loyalty. Teams can exceed the cap using exceptions, like Bird Rights (to re-sign their own players) or the Mid-Level Exception (for adding role players). 

Overall, these rules aim to prevent superteams, encourage player retention, and ensure fairer competition across big and small markets.

## NBA Team Payroll Distribution Over Time

The plot below visualizes the distribution of team payroll on an annual basis. Additionally, weâ€™ve plotted the soft cap and luxury tax threshold to show how many teams are comfortable paying a tax.

We see a significant jump in payroll from 2015 to 2016 due to the **$24B** TV deal, and a steady rise in recent years as teams anticipate a renewed cap hike. In 2024, the NBA announced a new **$75B** TV deal, along with a 10% increase in the salary cap.

## Player Salary Distribution by Team

Due to financial rules and the lack of free agent appeal in small markets, many teams are eager to retain top talent by offering max contracts to their homegrown talent. The following plot shows player salary distributions for each team over the last decade.

Key takeaways:

- Teams spend similarly on the bottom 75% of their rosters.
- The top-paid players receive significantly more than the rest, eliminating the NBA's _middle class_
- The **Golden State Warriors** have consistently had the highest-paid rosters.
- The **San Antonio Spurs**, **Orlando Magic**, and **New York Knicks** have not paid any individual player more than $30M/Year
  - While we may assume that the New York Knicks would draw top free agents, players have opted to sign for top dollar elsewhere because of culture and facilities

## The Cost of Winning in the NBA: Salary Efficiency Analysis

To better understand how financial investment translates to on-court performance, we visualized NBA team efficiency using salary and win data over multiple seasons. The scatter plot below compares each teamâ€™s **total payroll relative to the league-year average** (x-axis) with their **winning percentage** that season (y-axis).

<iframe src="/assets/plots/NBA_Winning_Percentage_Salary.html" height="950" width="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Each dot represents a team in a specific year. Dots to the right of the dashed line indicate **above-average payrolls**, while dots to the left indicate **below-average spending**. The vertical spread reflects how well those teams performed.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

- **Spending helps**: Most of the top-performing teams (above 60% win rate) tend to spend slightly above league average, but not wildly so. These include consistent contenders like the Celtics, Nuggets, and Heat.
  
- **High spend â‰  guaranteed success**: A significant number of teams that spent well over the league average still failed to surpass 50% win rates. This highlights inefficiencies or misallocated cap space (e.g. teams in transition, injured stars, or misfired free agent signings).

- **Efficient outperformers**: Some teams managed to win 60%+ of their games while spending **below average** â€” often driven by strong drafting, player development, or cap-savvy front offices. These seasons stand out as models of financial efficiency.

- **Under-investment rarely works**: Teams spending far below the average are heavily concentrated in the bottom-left of the chart â€” struggling both financially and competitively. Sustained under-investment typically yields poor results.

This visualization reinforces a theme common across leagues: **there is no direct price-per-win formula**. While investing in talent is necessary to compete, the **return on spending** varies dramatically depending on management decisions, culture, health, and roster construction.

## Regular Season Payroll vs. Playoff Qualification

This visualization compares regular season spending to playoff outcomes by plotting three salary thresholds:

- League-wide median
- Median for playoff teams
- Median for non-playoff teams

We also highlight:

- **Overachievers**: Teams that spent less than the median but made the playoffs
- **Underachievers**: Teams that spent more but missed the postseason

This analysis underscores two realities:

1. Massive payrolls do not assure playoff appearances.
2. Smart roster construction can allow lower-spending teams to compete and even thrive.

## Player Salary Distribution on Championship Teams

This chart compares player salary distribution on title-winning teams to the league as a whole.

{% include embed/iframe.html
  src="/assets/plots/NBA_Player_Salary_Distributions_Champion_vs_League.html"
  title="Champion Player Salary Distribution vs. League"
%}

There's no singular path to success:

- Only **two champions** had the leagueâ€™s **highest-paid player**: the **Golden State Warriors** and **Stephen Curry**.
- The bottom 75% of championship rosters vary from low to high payrolls relative to the rest of the league.
- All champions have multiple high-paid players, but the degree to which they're paid and how the rest of the team is compiled varies as teams opt for depth and balance.

Interestingly, the last repeat champion was the **Golden State Warriors (2017â€“2018)**, prior to the Supermax-era and hard cap restrictions. More interestingly a lot of the tighter financial restrictions were put in place in response to how this team was created, specifically the free agency of Kevin Durant. These financial changes have increased parity across the league, as teams continually have to work around these rules.

## Championship Team Payroll Relative to League

This final visualization shows how each championship teamâ€™s total payroll compares to league-wide distribution in that season.

{% include embed/iframe.html
  src="/assets/plots/NBA_Team_Salary_Distribution_Champions_Outliers.html"
  title="Champion Team Payroll vs. League"
%}

We observe:

- 3 champions had the leagueâ€™s highest payroll.
- 4 champions spent within the interquartile range (IQR).

The NBAâ€™s evolving financial structure, especially in the post-Supermax era, shows increasing parity and strategic diversity. Some teams spend big and win, while others build smarter and win. In a league driven by both star power and depth, understanding the salary landscape offers key insights into sustainable success.

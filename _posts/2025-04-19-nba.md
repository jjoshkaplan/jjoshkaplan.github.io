The NBA has implemented several financial rules to maintain competitive balance and prevent wealthier teams from dominating the league. 

To help teams retain their star players, the league introduced "Supermax" contracts in 2017, allowing franchises to offer bigger paydays to homegrown stars and discouraging them from joining superteams. In the last 10 years, the league has introduced stricter spending rules, including a hard cap that severely restricts teams exceeding it. These teams lose key roster-building tools, like trading future draft picks, signing mid-level free agents, or using buyout players. The luxury tax also penalizes overspending, with repeat offenders facing steeper fines, and the money collected is redistributed to smaller-market teams.

Player salaries are structured around the salary cap ($136 million in 2023–24), with max contracts varying by experience (25–35% of the cap). The "Supermax" lets teams pay franchise players even more to encourage loyalty. Teams can exceed the cap using exceptions, like Bird Rights (to re-sign their own players) or the Mid-Level Exception (for adding role players). Revenue sharing helps smaller-market teams compete financially, while rookie contracts and minimum-salary rules keep costs predictable.

Overall, these rules aim to prevent superteams, encourage player retention, and ensure fairer competition across big and small markets.

## NBA Team Payroll Distribution Over Time

The plot below visualizes the distribution of team payroll on an annual basis. Additionally, we’ve plotted the soft cap and luxury tax threshold to show how many teams are comfortable paying a tax.

We see a significant jump in payroll from 2015 to 2016 due to the $24B TV deal, and a steady rise in recent years as teams anticipate a renewed cap hike. In 2024, the NBA announced a new $75B TV deal, along with a 10% increase in the salary cap.

## Player Salary Distribution by Team

Due to financial rules and the lack of free agent appeal in small markets, many teams are eager to retain top talent by offering max contracts. The following plot shows player salary distributions for each team over the last decade.

**Key takeaways:**
- Teams spend similarly on the bottom 75% of their rosters.
- The top-paid players receive significantly more than the rest, eliminating the NBA's _middle class_
- The **Golden State Warriors** have consistently had the highest-paid rosters.
- The **San Antonio Spurs** and **Orlando Magic** have not paid any individual player more than $30M/Year

## Regular Season Payroll vs. Playoff Qualification

This visualization compares regular season spending to playoff outcomes by plotting three salary thresholds:
- League-wide median
- Median for playoff teams
- Median for non-playoff teams

We also highlight:
- **Overachievers**: Teams that spent less than the median but made the playoffs
- **Underachievers**: Teams that spent more but missed the postseason

This analysis underscores two realities:
1. Massive payrolls do not assure playoff appearances.
2. Smart roster construction can allow lower-spending teams to compete and even thrive.

## Player Salary Distribution on Championship Teams

This chart compares player salary distribution on title-winning teams to the league as a whole. There's no singular path to success:
- Only **two champions** had the league’s **highest-paid player**.
- The bottom 75% of championship rosters vary from low to high payrolls relative to the rest of the league.
- Some champions have multiple high-paid players while others win with depth and balance.

Interestingly, the last repeat champion was the **Golden State Warriors (2017–2018)**, prior to the Supermax-era and hard cap restrictions. More interestingly a lot of the tighter financial restrictions were put in place in response to how this team was created, specifically the free agency of Kevin Durant.
These financial changes have increased parity across the league.

The NBA’s evolving financial structure, especially in the post-Supermax era, shows increasing parity and strategic diversity. Some teams spend big and win, while others build smarter and win. In a league driven by both star power and depth, understanding the salary landscape offers key insights into sustainable success.

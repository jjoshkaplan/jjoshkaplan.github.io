The plot below highlights championship teams and builds on insights from earlier visualizations. It maps each team’s regular season win percentage against its payroll position relative to the league median.

Several key findings emerge:
- **Only NFL teams** have won championships while spending **below the league median**, reflecting the league’s greater parity and hard salary cap structure.
- Teams that spend **around the league median** can still capture titles—but typically only when they significantly **overachieve in the regular season**.
- Even the combination of **high spending and strong win percentage** doesn't guarantee postseason success. Several teams in the top-right quadrant (high payroll, high win %) still fell short of winning it all.

This reinforces the idea that while financial investment and regular season dominance help, **championships demand more**—whether it’s postseason resilience, matchup advantages, or simply timing and health.

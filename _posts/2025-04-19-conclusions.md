While individual performance metrics have grown increasingly sophisticated, we’ve focused on team-level outcomes to better reflect the collective nature of success in professional sports.

## Final Thoughts

Baseball, basketball, and football are all inherently collaborative; no single player, regardless of talent or salary, can independently drive a team to sustained success.

Evaluating success at the team level also aligns with how payroll is structured and managed. Front offices don’t just pay for stars, they build rosters. By aggregating payroll against team outcomes, we can more accurately assess how financial strategy correlates with organizational success across leagues. Yet, financial investment is only part of the equation. Cultural stability, intelligent drafting, and strategic player development play critical roles in translating payroll into performance.

In the NBA, while superstar impact is undeniable, depth, defense, and roster cohesion often determine postseason viability. In the NFL, positional interdependence such as offensive line play influencing quarterback success makes team-level evaluation essential. Notably, none of the top 10 highest-paid quarterbacks have won a Super Bowl, illustrating the risks of heavy investment in one position within a team-oriented game. Even in the MLB, where individual contributions can be more isolated, team-level dynamics like bullpen depth, lineup balance, and rotation health play crucial roles across a 162-game season.

### Considerations

One of the broad consideration we’ve taken into account when publishing our findings is related to player contract valuations and owner collusion. In the 1980’s MLB owners colluded against the players to prevent free agents from being paid their market value. The best players would not receive competitive offers from teams and often returned back to their home club. The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) filed grievances, and arbitrators ruled in favor of the players in all three cases. There is a risk that collusion could rise again and severely impact the various players across all sports leagues.

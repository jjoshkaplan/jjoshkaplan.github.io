Major League Baseball (MLB) has introduced a number of financial and structural rules in recent years designed to promote competitive balance and prevent wealthier teams from monopolizing success. At the center of this effort is the **luxury tax**, officially known as the **Competitive Balance Tax (CBT)**.

## The Role of the Luxury Tax

The luxury tax penalizes teams that exceed a predetermined payroll threshold. In 2024, that threshold sits at **$237 million**. Teams that go over it face escalating fines:
- **20%** for first-time offenders  
- **30%** for repeat offenders  
- Up to **50% or more** for habitual overspenders

Clubs that significantly exceed the threshold may even incur **additional taxes up to 110%**, along with the loss of high-value draft picks. This system is designed to curb excessive spending by large-market teams and encourage financial discipline across the league.

## Supporting Small-Market Teams

To further promote equity, MLB enforces **revenue sharing**, whereby **48% of local revenues** from wealthier teams are redistributed to smaller-market franchises. This helps smaller clubs compete in the player market and invest in team development.

MLB also limits how much teams can spend on **amateur draft picks** and **international free agents**. Each team receives a bonus pool, and exceeding it results in penalties such as fines or the loss of future signing opportunities. These limits prevent wealthier teams from monopolizing top young talent.

## Expanded Playoffs and Anti-Tanking Measures

Since 2022, MLB has expanded its playoff format to include **12 teams**, increasing postseason access for mid-tier spenders and boosting league-wide fan engagement and revenue opportunities.

In a further move to prevent **"tanking"**—where teams lose games intentionally to improve their draft position—the league introduced a **draft lottery** in 2022. The **top six picks** are now determined randomly among non-playoff teams, reducing the incentive to lose games on purpose.

Together, these systems form a framework intended to ensure that teams of all sizes can build competitive rosters and meaningfully contend for championships.

The visualization above shows how team payrolls have evolved annually across MLB. Each year, we see a wide range of spending, from low-budget rebuilds to powerhouse franchises pushing the luxury tax limit. The **luxury tax threshold** is overlaid to show how the line of penalty enforcement has gradually increased. Notably, a growing number of teams are willing to **exceed the luxury tax**, signaling a shift in strategy and willingness to spend for contention.

This visualization dives deeper, showing each team's payroll distribution over the past decade. It paints a stark picture of disparity: a few teams have consistently high spending, while others hover near the bottom.

Some notable insights:
- The **COVID-affected 2020 season** stands out with many teams deviating from their usual spending patterns.
- The **New York Mets** and **San Diego Padres** show median spending close to the league average but have seasons where they spend among the most in the league.
  - The Mets' spike aligns with their 2020 sale to new owner **Steve Cohen**, known for his aggressive investment in the roster.
  - The Padres’ surge reflects ownership responding to strong fan support with a commitment to fielding a competitive team.

## Playoff Thresholds and Spending Outliers

While payroll often correlates with success, it doesn’t guarantee postseason entry. This visualization compares regular season spending to playoff outcomes by plotting three salary thresholds:
- League-wide median
- Median for playoff teams
- Median for non-playoff teams

Additionally, it highlights:
- **Overachievers** – teams that made the playoffs despite spending below the median
- **Underachievers** – teams that missed the playoffs despite spending above the median

This analysis underscores two realities:
1. Massive payrolls do not assure playoff appearances.
2. Smart roster construction can allow lower-spending teams to compete and even thrive.

## Championship Spending: Where Do Winners Fall?

In this final plot, we evaluate how **World Series champions** have ranked within their season’s salary distribution.

   title="MLB Payroll Distribution with World Series Champions Highlighted" 
   height="500" 
%}


- **7 out of the last 10 champions** have ranked in the **top quartile of spending**.
- However, **only once** has the league’s **highest-spending team won the title**.

This reinforces that while **spending matters**, it’s no silver bullet. Roster balance, health, and postseason execution remain critical, and overreliance on spending can still fall short of ultimate success.

## Final Thoughts

MLB’s evolving financial framework has introduced more parity into the league—but challenges remain. While some big spenders dominate headlines, data shows that well-managed, mid-market teams can still punch above their weight. Through luxury tax penalties, revenue sharing, bonus restrictions, and expanded playoffs, the league is striving for a structure where **strategy and execution** matter just as much as **checkbook size**.
